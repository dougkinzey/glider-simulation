# glider-sampling-simulation
Simulated underwater glider sampling for Antarctic krill

To run the simulation, download all files in the 'R' and 'Data' directories and the rmarkdown files ('.rmd') from the 'Main' directory into the same working directory. Render the rmd scripts using 'knitr'. The results are shown in 'Main' for 9 replicate samples in the pdfs for the corresponding '.rmd' files. This produces about 8 GB of output files and takes several minutes. More replicates will produce better statistical results but requires more time and produces more output. 100 replicates can require several days on a multicore computer and produces about 40 GB of output files.

# glider-sampling-simulation
Simulated underwater glider sampling for Antarctic krill

To run the simulation, download all files in the 'R' and 'Data' directories and the rmarkdown files ('.rmd') from the 'Main' directory into the same working directory. Render the rmd scripts using 'knitr'. The results for one random simulation of 9 replicate samples are shown in the pdfs in the 'Main' directory for the corresponding '.rmd' files. The resolution of the pdfs is better when they are downloaded. 

This simulation produces about 8 GB of output files and takes several minutes. More replicates will produce better statistical results but require more time and produce more output. 100 replicates can require several days on a multicore computer and produces about 40 GB of output files.

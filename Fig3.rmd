# Load the database of acoustic backscatter coefficients (s[a])
# and calculate the summed s[a] at each 5m depth in the database
'NASC_leg1.RData' (dimensions 100 x 199772) contains the krill acoustic backscatter values (s[a]) binned into 100 m horizontal by 5 m vertical cells  (transposed in the simulation functions for easier visualization).

'Fig3_sum_sa.r' produces a plot of the summed s[a] values at each depth, illustrating the overall relationship of krill density with depth.

```{r load_data}
load('NASC_leg1.RData')
source(Fig3_sum_sa.r)

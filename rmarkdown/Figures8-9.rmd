Figure 8. Coverage probabilities for 1, 2, 3, and 5 gliders in Bransfield Strait (BS) and Cape Shirreff (CS). The expected value of 68% is shown as the dashed black line.

Figure 9. Estimated densities using the delta distribution and yos as the sampling unit Â± one SD from all replicates of a single glider (lines) with a maximum yo depth of 150 m for Bransfield Strait (a) and Cape Shirreff (b), and the annual mean densities of the population (points).
